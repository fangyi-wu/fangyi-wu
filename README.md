## 🧠 About Me

I’m a data scientist and finance researcher passionate about leveraging machine learning for impact in social science, innovation finance, and inclusive finance. I’m currently pursuing my M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago (GPA: 4.0), building on my background in Finance and Mathematics from Tulane University (GPA: 3.97).

My recent work includes:
- 🧩 Engineering structured features from patent records and R&D investments to model innovation activity in Chinese SMEs.
- 🤖 Developing machine learning models (logistic regression, random forests, KNN) to forecast startup success based on innovation inputs.
- 📈 Building a real-time algorithmic trading system that integrates technical indicators, NLP-based sentiment analysis, and predictive models for stock trading.

These projects reflect my passion for using data-driven methods to better understand economic systems, improve financial decision-making, and drive social impact.
